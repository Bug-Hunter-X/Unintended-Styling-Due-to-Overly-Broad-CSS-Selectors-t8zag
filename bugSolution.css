Instead of using overly broad selectors like `div`, be more specific. Use class selectors, IDs, or more specific element selectors combined with class/ID selectors for better control. For example, instead of:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}
```

Use:

```css
.my-specific-div {
  color: blue;
}
```

Or, if the div has an ID:

```css
#my-unique-div {
  color: blue;
}
```
This ensures the style only applies to the intended elements, preventing unintended side effects.
